======
I am an energy-efficiency professional and program manager with more than ten years of experience delivering residential, commercial, and institutional energy programs. My academic training spans environmental studies, sustainable systems engineering, and energy management. I hold a B.S. in Environmental Studies (Energy Studies emphasis) from Northern Illinois University and am completing a Master of Science in Sustainability with an Energy Management emphasis at Eastern Illinois University (expected May 2026). I am additionally credentialed as a BPI Certified Building Analyst, Envelope Professional, Energy Auditor, and Quality Control Inspector.

My professional work reflects a sustained commitment to energy equity, technical excellence, and poverty alleviation through energy affordability. I have led or supported projects across a broad range of sectors—including mobile homes, single-family residences, multifamily buildings, schools, universities, military bases, hospitals, laboratories, correctional facilities, and local government facilities. My technical expertise includes building performance diagnostics, HVAC and envelope analysis, lighting and water conservation surveys, and whole-building energy modeling using tools such as Real Home Analyzer, Hancock HEAT, TREAT, CoolCalc, and ACCA Speed Sheets.

Professional Focus and Contributions
======
Across my roles, I have specialized in designing and managing income-qualified energy efficiency programs that integrate technical rigor with community-centered, stakeholder-driven delivery models. My work has included grant management, contractor development, performance reporting, and cross-sector collaboration with Community Action Agencies, utility partners, nonprofits, and trade allies.

In Champaign County, I managed over $700,000 in grant-funded weatherization services, supporting more than 100 households and expanding contractor participation from three to ten vendors. Service delivery increased from eight clients in Program Year 2023 to seventy-five in Program Year 2024—exceeding grant targets by 200%.

At Future Energy Enterprises, I serve as Channel Manager for the Ameren Illinois Mobile Home Initiative, overseeing program planning, deployment, technical innovation pilots, and stakeholder engagement across the Ameren Illinois service territory. In this role, I lead a team of energy professionals focused on equitable service to mobile home residents and support program operations through quarterly presentations, partner coordination, and quality assurance.

Earlier positions with ENVOCORE, Franklin Energy, and CLEAResult provided a foundation in large-scale commercial energy surveying, residential diagnostics, contractor support, direct installation, and field quality control. These early experiences deepened my understanding of building science and informed my approach to program design and implementation.

Leadership and Mentorship
------
Leadership is a central part of my professional and academic identity. I have guided multidisciplinary teams through complex operational contexts, including the disruptions created by COVID-19 and government shutdowns. My approach emphasizes mentorship, collaborative problem-solving, and talent development. Colleagues and contractors alike benefit from structured onboarding, technical coaching, and continuous quality improvement strategies.

I am particularly committed to developing emerging professionals in the energy space. My work is grounded in the belief that equitable service delivery is inseparable from equitable workforce development.

Community Commitment
------
Beyond my programmatic work, I am actively involved in community service. I have been recognized as one of Champaign County’s Forty Under 40 (2024) by Central Illinois Business Insider and selected as part of the United Way’s Emerging Community Leaders (Class of 2023). I regularly volunteer with local literacy initiatives, including the Read, Talk, Play Everyday program, which provides books and early learning materials to over 400 families annually.

**Professional Mission**

My overarching mission is to expand access to high-quality energy efficiency services for historically underserved communities. I believe that energy affordability is foundational to economic stability, public health, and long-term sustainability. Through both academic research and professional practice, I aim to advance program models that are data-driven, community-grounded, and equity-centered.
